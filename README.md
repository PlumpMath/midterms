# Midterm Elections Education

This repo is for a project to educate voters for the 2018 midterms.

Given a voter's address, alert them to who they can vote for, as well
as their representative's prior history.

Goal is to ask some simple questions are issues and let voters know
how strongly a candidate aligns/maligns with their views.
